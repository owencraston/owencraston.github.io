Hello, my name is Owen and I am a young software developer from Canada. I studied computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa. I was also part of the first ever [Dev Degree cohort](https://devdegree.ca/), during which I gained experience in everything data science, to cloud security. I am currently working as a full time developer at Shopify working on integrating hardware with the Shopify point of sale React Native application.I plan to use this blog as a way to document useful information I come across in my professional and person life. You can expect to see everything from mobile development tricks to organization hacks and everything in between.
